Fun House Pizza
======================
This project was designed to meet the requirements of the LC101 course by LaunchCode. This website allows for customers to order pizza from a local pizza shop and bring the company's website up to date. 

## Description
This is a website designed for a local pizza shop to provide information regarding the menu and location of the restaurant. Customers are able to do the following on the webpage:
- Submit feedback regarding service and orders
- Order items off the menu
  - as a guest
  - with an account
- Find the location and contact information 

## Future
As I progress on this project, I would like to implement the following features in the future:
- Establish a delivery zone to determine if an order falls within that zone
- Progress of the order and when it will be roughly completed 
- Create some type of reward system after so many orders for each customer
